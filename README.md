# 8x8 LED matrix Click(tm) board

Playing with the 8x8 (R) LED matrix Click Board.

Need:

* Device: PIC16F1509 (or other PIC16F1 in 20-pin DIP)
* Board: PICDEM(tm) Low Pin Count + mikroBUS connector = [Simplicity](https://github.com/luciodj/Simplicity) 
* Debugger: PICkit(tm) 3

## The Basic Idea
1. Add a [MikroBUS](http://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus/) connector to the LPC board 
2. Connect an [8x8 R LED matrix Click Board](http://www.mikroe.com/click/8x8-r/) 
3. Launch MPLAB X and MPLAB Code Configurator to quickly initialise all the peripherals
4. Play ...


## Limitations
* Got lazy, did not complete the entire ASCII font ... wonna help!?
